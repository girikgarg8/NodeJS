What is cloud? And why do we require cloud machines, why not only local machines?


Cloud refers to remote machines which provide on-demand access to respurces on pay-as-you-go basis. 
Using local machines isn't feasible because our local machine can't handle large number of requests,also local machine doesn't provide us the requsiuste security functions. 

Amazon has data-centers at different locations worldwide, and these centers have the remote machines

EC2==> Virtual servers in cloud==? EC2 helps to get me an instance (instance means a machine on the cloud ) where we can deploy our application


In order to communicate with internal instances, we can setup a VPC (virtual private connection)
