Microservices-based project for airline booking system, allowing users to search for flights, book tickets, and
receive email notifications for flight tickets.

Salient features of the project:

* Used message brokers for inter-service communication between microservices.
* Implemented cron notifications for sending email notifications to users at fixed intervals before their flights.
* Designed an API gateway for rate limiting requests and serving as a reverse proxy between the frontend and
backend.
