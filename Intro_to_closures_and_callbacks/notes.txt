====Intro to closures and callbacks video====

We are going to use setTimeout and setInterval functions for code demonstration.

setTimeout and setInterval are not functions defined by Javascript, as they are not present in the official ECMAScript documentation. But we are able to access these functions. 

How are we still able to access these functions? Will be answered in some lectures.

setTimeout is a function that helps to execute some task once after a certain timer

setInterval: It is a function that helps us to execute some task again and again after a given interval. (Example: there could be a usecase, where I want to check database periodically after some interval)

===What is a bacllback function===

Callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked (called) inside the outer function to complete some kind of action or routinue, in mathematical terms it's f(g(x))

Arguments vs parameters? Argument is what the function expects, like fun(x) expects an argument but when we call fun(5), we are passing 5 as the parameter.

Callback is not just a concept in Javascript, even in languages like C++, we can pass a function to another function, using function pointers.

arr.mp(fn): it passes all the elements (one-by-one) of the given array as argument to the callback function.

Also, arr.map returns an array after calculating the results for all the arguments passed as arguments. See the code examples file to understand better. map function never modifies the original array.

Let's try to create a custom mapper funtion, which is a polyfill for map function in Javascript. Important interview question.

setTimeout(callbackTask,timeInMilliseconds)
