So, REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

Baically REST is architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services or APIs.

APIs define conventions for performing CRUD operations, like for create, the convention is

1. API endpoint is '/blogs' and method is POST, the data to be posted is specified in body params like {
    "title": "Secret Seven",
    "author" : "Enid Blyton"
}
